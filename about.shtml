                <p>Ann E. Wilson, D.C. <br>

                My patients affectionately call me Dr. Ann. They appreciate that I inspire them to trust their body’s ability to heal and to understand the underlying root of their condition. I offer them the specific home care tools they need to complement the treatment I provide. Having been a teacher prior to becoming a chiropractor, I am always in ‘teaching mode’ with my patients. As they say, “Knowledge is power.”</p>

                <p>My knowledge and skills as a physician were honed at Western States Chiropractic College (now known as University of Western States). Shortly after graduation, I was invited back to teach at the University of Western States. In this position I supervised senior level chiropractic students during their final year of internship.</p>

                <p>My family of patients <br>

                I have been blessed with a wonderful family of patients who value my comprehensive and gentle approach to treatment. This has been the cornerstone of my practice. My patients regularly refer their family members, co-workers and friends to me. I offer a variety of treatments that fit each patient’s condition and need. For those who prefer not to be “popped”, I offer comfortable and effective ArthroStim and VibraCussor treatment. </p>

                <p>My patients will tell you:<br>


                        •&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a good listener, I do not give up, and I do not keep my patients waiting. <br>
                        •&nbsp;&nbsp;I make every effort to schedule you as soon as possible—sometimes the same day.<br>
                        •&nbsp;&nbsp;I explain everything I do BEFORE I do it. (I am an old teacher after all.)<br>
                        •&nbsp;&nbsp;I have exceptional tools and equipment that set my office apart from most chiropractic offices.<br>
                        •&nbsp;&nbsp;I take most insurance plans. We will work with you to obtain care if you have no insurance.
                </p>
                <p>My wish for you <br>
                My goal is always to find the shortest and most effective path to help you feel good—even great again—and then teach you a thing or two about how to take care of yourself in order to avoid chronic, debilitating conditions that rob you of your quality of life.</p>
